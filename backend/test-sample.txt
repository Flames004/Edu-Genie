Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines that work and react like humans. AI systems are designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. ML focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Key concepts in Machine Learning include:
1. Supervised Learning: Uses labeled training data to learn a function that maps inputs to outputs
2. Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns in data without labeled examples
3. Neural Networks: Computing systems inspired by biological neural networks
4. Deep Learning: A subset of ML based on artificial neural networks with multiple layers

Applications of AI and ML include autonomous vehicles, recommendation systems, medical diagnosis, natural language processing, and computer vision. These technologies are transforming industries and creating new possibilities for innovation and problem-solving.
